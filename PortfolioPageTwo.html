    <h4>Above is a video demonstration of the group game I produced in GIMM.</h4>
    <p>The main objective of this project was to modify another program just like we <br>
        did for the first flash assignment but this time working with a group. <br>
        Working on a project with other people for the first time was quite an <br>
        interesting experience. Making notes and easy to read code was an interesting <br>
        task to be given. Durring this project my group experienced a lack of <br>
        equal effort. One student was taking a back seat to this project, thus <br>
        putting the weight of the entire project on to just me and my other groupmate. <br>
        We discussed this with our GIMM advisor and we had him delt with in a professional <br>
        manner. This project was a very interesting look into what needs to happen to <br>
        group members or "employees" that won't hold their wight when working on a project. <br>
