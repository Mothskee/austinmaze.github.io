    <h4>Above is a video demonstration of the mobile flash game I produced in GIMM.</h4>
     <p> Unfortunately, The game seems to crash now due to some changes Adobe has made to animate <br>
      and I was unable to record the rest of the functions or gameplay of the rest of the app. <br>
      This was my first step into developing for a mobile device. It's very similar to regular <br>
      development except for the screen ratio and actions needing to be bigger to accomadate using <br>
      a phone screen. This was also a group project but this went much better than the previous one <br>
      Everyone held their weight and contributed to the project. It was an overall great experience <br>
      and one I hope I'll be able to experience again. <br>
