  <h4>Above is a video demonstration of my very first game I produced in GIMM.</h4>
  <p>This game was a very tough start for the me in the GIMM program. <br>
    We were given a very basic flash game base and access to the code. <br>
    Through what we were taught in class and learned ourselves, we were to <br>
    modify the game; Add new mechanics, make completely original artwork, and <br>
    create an intro cutscene using code from greensock. It was a brutal assignment <br>
    but taught us what it means to be a programmer and just how tough it can be. <br>

  <h4>Above is a video demonstration of the group game I produced in GIMM.</h4>
  <p>The main objective of this project was to modify another program just like we <br>
    did for the first flash assignment but this time working with a group. <br>
    Working on a project with other people for the first time was quite an <br>
    interesting experience. Making notes and easy to read code was an interesting <br>
    task to be given. Durring this project my group experienced a lack of <br>
    equal effort. One student was taking a back seat to this project, thus <br>
    putting the weight of the entire project on to just me and my other groupmate. <br>
    We discussed this with our GIMM advisor and we had him delt with in a professional <br>
    manner. This project was a very interesting look into what needs to happen to <br>
    group members or "employees" that won't hold their wight when working on a project. <br>

  <h4>Above is a video demonstration of the mobile flash game I produced in GIMM.</h4>
  <p> Unfortunately, The game seems to crash now due to some changes Adobe has made to animate <br>
    and I was unable to record the rest of the functions or gameplay of the rest of the app. <br>
    This was my first step into developing for a mobile device. It's very similar to regular <br>
    development except for the screen ratio and actions needing to be bigger to accomadate using <br>
    a phone screen. This was also a group project but this went much better than the previous one <br>
    Everyone held their weight and contributed to the project. It was an overall great experience <br>
    and one I hope I'll be able to experience again. <br>
